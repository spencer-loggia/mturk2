Spencer / Bevil one-on-one notes 09/16

- Separating monkeys is a pain, hopefully will get better as target training progresses
	- put up boxes before separating, see if the go where they need to be?

- mturk2 box circuitry complete

- Buiding mturk2 box
	- waiting on plans from nick…
	-  if don’t get plans shortly will take some measurements, see if any old mturk1 box parts could be repurposed
	- possibly can build a box w/o the machine shop

- Juice sucking intervention
	- stalling a bit 
	- will have to talk to the machine shop, get them to drill holes in some aluminum stock?

- Mturk2 analysis / paradigm code
	- second pardigm adjustment today, added 2 second timeout between all trials. 
	- all monkeys should be getting same juice / reward
	- calculate each pumps juice delivery per unit reward time the previous day, set reward duration for current day accordingly 
	- employ location bias correction code… eventually
	- modify historical graphs to have x-axis by month 

-Color Calibration
	- plan to test whether projector calibration is actually accurate tomorrow
		- may do MRI instead do to scanner shutdown, tbd
	- also will get readings of currency presented colors from mturk1 tablets

- fmri
	- pipeline is working
	- got some meridian mapping
	- python version of pipeline still has issues related to proper surface projection 

Baby monkeys are bouncy
